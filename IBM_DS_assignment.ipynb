### Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python
eval("2 +4")

eval("sum([2,3,7])")

eval("5 * 4")

# This a simple arithmetic expression to mutiply then add integers
(3*4)+5

# This will convert 200 minutes to hours by diving by 60

min = 200
hours = min / 60
print(hours)
